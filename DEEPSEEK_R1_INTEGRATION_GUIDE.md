## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add your DeepSeek API key to your `.env` file:

```bash
# DeepSeek API Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# Optional: Other provider keys for fallback
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
from deepseek_reasoning_integration import DeepSeekReasoningOrchestrator, ReasoningRequest

# Initialize the cosmic orchestrator
orchestrator = DeepSeekReasoningOrchestrator()

# Quick reasoning for simple queries
answer = await orchestrator.quick_reason("What is machine learning?")
print(answer)

# Deep reasoning for complex problems
response = await orchestrator.deep_reason(
    "Design a distributed system for real-time collaborative editing",
    context="Consider scalability, consistency, and conflict resolution"
)

print(f"Complexity: {response.complexity}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence}")
print(f"Answer: {response.final_answer}")
```

### 3. Advanced Configuration

```python
# Enable Ultimate Mode (always use reasoning model)
orchestrator.set_ultimate_mode(True)

# Set reasoning mode
orchestrator.set_reasoning_mode("hybrid")  # "local", "ai", or "hybrid"

# Custom reasoning request
request = ReasoningRequest(
    query="How would you implement a blockchain consensus algorithm?",
    max_thoughts=15,
    force_reasoning=True,
    ultimate_mode=True,
    reasoning_mode="ai",
    include_context_retrieval=True
)

response = await orchestrator.reason(request)
```

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Reasoning Modes Explained

### Local Mode (`"local"`)
- **Best for**: Offline scenarios, privacy-sensitive queries
- **Speed**: Fastest
- **Quality**: Good for structured problems
- **Uses**: Traditional VoidCat sequential thinking only

### AI Mode (`"ai"`)
- **Best for**: Complex reasoning, creative problem-solving
- **Speed**: Slower but thorough
- **Quality**: Highest for complex problems
- **Uses**: DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model exclusively

### Hybrid Mode (`"hybrid"`) - **Recommended**
- **Best for**: Balanced approach, most scenarios
- **Speed**: Optimized based on complexity
- **Quality**: Best of both worlds
- **Uses**: Combines local reasoning with AI enhancement

## üéØ Intelligent Routing Examples

### Simple Query ‚Üí DeepSeek-Chat
```python
# These queries automatically use the fast chat model
queries = [
    "What is Python?",
    "Define machine learning",
    "Who invented the internet?",
    "When was JavaScript created?"
]

for query in queries:
    response = await orchestrator.reason(query)
    # Uses: deepseek-chat (fast, efficient)
```

### Complex Query ‚Üí DeepSeek-R1
```python
# These queries automatically trigger reasoning model
queries = [
    "Analyze the trade-offs between microservices and monolithic architectures",
    "Design a fault-tolerant distributed database system",
    "Explain quantum entanglement and its implications for computing",
    "Optimize this algorithm for better performance and explain your reasoning"
]

for query in queries:
    response = await orchestrator.reason(query)
    # Uses: deepseek-reasoner (deep reasoning)
```

## üöÄ Ultimate Mode

Ultimate Mode forces the use of reasoning models for ALL queries, even simple ones:

```python
# Enable Ultimate Mode
orchestrator.set_ultimate_mode(True)

# Even simple queries now use reasoning model
response = await orchestrator.reason("Hello, how are you?")
# Uses: deepseek-reasoner (maximum cosmic power!)

# Disable when you want balanced approach
orchestrator.set_ultimate_mode(False)
```

## üìä Monitoring & Diagnostics

### System Status
```python
status = orchestrator.get_system_status()
print(f"Ultimate Mode: {status['orchestrator']['ultimate_mode']}")
print(f"Reasoning Mode: {status['orchestrator']['reasoning_mode']}")

# Provider performance
for provider, info in status['providers'].items():
    print(f"{provider}: {info['metrics']['success_rate']:.1f}% success rate")
```

### Health Checks
```python
health = await orchestrator.health_check()
for component, is_healthy in health.items():
    status = "‚úÖ Healthy" if is_healthy else "‚ùå Unhealthy"
    print(f"{component}: {status}")
```

### Reasoning Analytics
```python
response = await orchestrator.deep_reason("Complex query here")

print(f"Processing Time: {response.processing_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Thought Count: {response.thought_count}")
print(f"AI Enhanced: {response.ai_enhanced}")
print(f"Provider Used: {response.provider_used}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence:.2f}")

# Detailed reasoning path
for i, branch in enumerate(response.reasoning_path):
    print(f"Branch {i+1}: {branch['description']}")
    for thought in branch['thoughts']:
        print(f"  - {thought['content'][:100]}...")
```

## üîß Direct Multi-Provider Usage

For more control, you can use the enhanced MultiProviderClient directly:

```python
from multi_provider_client import MultiProviderClient

client = MultiProviderClient()

# Simple chat completion with intelligent routing
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}]
response = await client.chat_completion(messages)

# Force reasoning model
response = await client.reasoning_completion(messages)

# Ultimate Mode
client.set_ultimate_mode(True)
response = await client.chat_completion(messages)  # Now uses reasoning model

# Check which provider was used
metadata = response.get("metadata", {})
print(f"Provider: {metadata.get('provider_used')}")
print(f"Used Reasoning: {metadata.get('used_reasoning_model')}")
```

## üåü Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Mode
- **Quick answers**: Use `quick_reason()` 
- **Complex analysis**: Use `deep_reason()`
- **Custom needs**: Use `reason()` with ReasoningRequest

### 2. Monitor Performance
```python
# Regular health checks
health = await orchestrator.health_check()
if not all(health.values()):
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components are unhealthy")

# Performance monitoring
status = orchestrator.get_system_status()
for provider, info in status['providers'].items():
    if info['metrics']['success_rate'] < 80:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {provider} has low success rate")
```

### 3. Handle Failures Gracefully
```python
try:
    response = await orchestrator.deep_reason("Complex query")
    if response.metadata and response.metadata.get('error'):
        print(f"Reasoning completed with warnings: {response.metadata['error']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Reasoning failed: {e}")
    # Fallback to simpler approach
    answer = await orchestrator.quick_reason("Simplified version of query")
```

### 4. Optimize for Your Use Case
```python
# For research/analysis applications
orchestrator.set_reasoning_mode("ai")
orchestrator.set_ultimate_mode(True)

# For production chatbots (balanced)
orchestrator.set_reasoning_mode("hybrid")
orchestrator.set_ultimate_mode(False)

# For offline/privacy scenarios
orchestrator.set_reasoning_mode("local")
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Basic functionality test
python test_deepseek_integration.py

# Full demo with examples
python demo_deepseek_reasoning.py

# Multi-provider client test
python multi_provider_client.py
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DeepSeek-R1 Model Unavailable**
   - The system automatically falls back to other providers
   - Check your API key and quota
   - Monitor provider status with `get_system_status()`

2. **Slow Response Times**
   - Reasoning models are slower than chat models
   - Use `quick_reason()` for simple queries
   - Consider adjusting `max_thoughts` parameter

3. **Context7 Integration Issues**
   - Context7 is optional and will be disabled if dependencies fail
   - Install required packages: `pip install scikit-learn numpy`
   - Or disable with `DeepSeekReasoningOrchestrator(enable_context7=False)`

### Debug Mode
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Now you'll see detailed logs of the reasoning process
response = await orchestrator.reason("Your query here")
```
