# Security Notice - API Key Management

## Important Security Update

This notice addresses API key management and security best practices for the VoidCat Reasoning Core project.

## Current Status ✅

- **Good News**: API keys were never committed to the git repository
- The `.env` file is properly ignored by git (see `.gitignore` line 2)
- Only `.env.example` with placeholder values is tracked in git
- Local `.env` file has been sanitized with placeholder values

## Required Actions for Users

### 1. Set Up Your API Keys

Copy the example environment file and add your actual API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# DeepSeek API Configuration (optional)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_actual_deepseek_api_key_here

# OpenRouter API Configuration (optional)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here
```

### 2. Verify .env is Ignored

Ensure your `.env` file is not tracked by git:

```bash
git status
# .env should NOT appear in the output
```

### 3. Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env` files** containing actual API keys
- **Regenerate API keys** if you suspect they may have been exposed
- **Use environment variables** in production deployments
- **Rotate API keys regularly** as a security best practice
