# Fixing the Agentic Tools Entry in Claude Desktop Configuration

## Problem
The `agentic-tools` entry in the `claude_desktop_config.json` file was outdated and did not reflect the global installation of the Agentic Tools MCP. Additionally, the `workingDirectory` field was deemed unnecessary.

## Solution
1. **Update the `agentic-tools` Entry:**
   - Changed the `command` to `agentic-tools-mcp` to reflect the global installation.
   - Removed the `workingDirectory` field as it was not required for globally installed tools.

2. **Steps Taken:**
   - Edited the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to update the `agentic-tools` entry.
   - Verified the changes to ensure the JSON was valid and correctly formatted.

### Final Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // ...existing code...
    "agentic-tools": {
      "command": "agentic-tools-mcp",
      "args": [
        "-y"
      ]
    },
    // ...existing code...
  }
}
```

## Testing
- Verified the functionality of the globally installed Agentic Tools MCP by creating a test entry in tasks and memories.
- Ensured the configuration changes were applied successfully and the tool worked as expected.

## Notes
- The `workingDirectory` field is not necessary for globally installed tools.
- Future updates to the configuration should ensure compatibility with global installations.
