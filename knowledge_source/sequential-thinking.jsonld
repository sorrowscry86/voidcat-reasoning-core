In the context of AI systems, it refers to the ability to break down complex queries into manageable steps, explore multiple reasoning paths, and synthesize a comprehensive response.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Systematic Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into simpler sub-problems\n2. **Multi-path Exploration**: Considering multiple approaches to solving a problem\n3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improving solutions through feedback\n4. **Explicit Reasoning**: Making the reasoning process transparent and explainable\n5. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluating the reliability of each reasoning step",
