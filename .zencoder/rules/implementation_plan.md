# VoidCat Reasoning Core Implementation Plan

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of the VoidCat Reasoning Core system based on the repository information.

## Environment Setup

- [x] Create Python virtual environment (Python 3.13 for development)
- [ ] Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Configure environment variables (.env file with OPENAI_API_KEY)

## Core Components Implementation

### 1. Base Engine (engine.py)
- [x] Implement TF-IDF vectorization for document processing
- [x] Create document loading and processing functionality
- [x] Implement context retrieval using cosine similarity
- [x] Add OpenAI API integration for query processing
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Engine (enhanced_engine.py)
- [x] Extend base engine with advanced reasoning capabilities
- [ ] Implement additional context processing methods
- [ ] Add support for multiple reasoning strategies
- [ ] Integrate with sequential thinking module

### 3. API Gateway (api_gateway.py)
- [x] Create FastAPI application with proper metadata
- [x] Implement health check endpoints
- [x] Add query processing endpoint with validation
- [x] Implement proper error handling and response formatting
- [ ] Add authentication and rate limiting

### 4. MCP Server (mcp_server.py)
- [x] Implement Model Control Protocol server
- [ ] Add support for all required MCP primitives
- [ ] Ensure proper integration with the core engine
- [ ] Implement secure communication channels

### 5. Sequential Thinking (sequential_thinking.py)
- [x] Implement sequential reasoning capabilities
- [ ] Add support for multi-step problem solving
- [ ] Integrate with the enhanced engine

### 6. Context7 Integration (context7_integration.py)
- [x] Create integration with Context7 system
- [ ] Implement data exchange protocols
- [ ] Add support for Context7-specific features

## Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for all core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for system interactions
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with the test harness (main.py)

## Docker Configuration

- [x] Create Dockerfile with proper multi-stage build
- [x] Configure Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Test Docker build and runtime functionality
- [ ] Verify container health checks

## CI/CD Setup

- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for testing (test.yml)
- [x] Set up Docker image publishing workflow (docker-publish.yml)
- [ ] Add security scanning for Docker images
- [ ] Configure automated deployment to staging/production

## Documentation

- [x] Create repository information document (repo.md)
- [x] Create implementation plan (this document)
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for system operation
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

## Knowledge Base

- [ ] Create initial markdown documents for knowledge_source/
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation on MCP primitives
- [ ] Include system architecture documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and tutorials

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run complete test suite
- [ ] Verify Docker deployment
- [ ] Test API functionality
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is complete and accurate
