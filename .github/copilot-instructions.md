## PROJECT RULES, CODING STANDARDS, WORKFLOW GUIDELINES, REFERENCES, DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURES, AND BEST PRACTICES

This file serves as the central source of truth for all project-related rules, coding standards, workflow guidelines, references, documentation structures, and best practices. The AI coding assistant must adhere to these guidelines at all times. This document is a living document and will evolve as the project progresses.
